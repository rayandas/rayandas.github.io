<p>In the modern era, a software is commonly delivered as a service, called <code>web apps</code> or <code>software-as-a-service</code>. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps.</p>
<p>I intend to summarise the twelve-factor app as a set of bullet points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Codebase - Single codebase and that codebase is not shared between apps.</li>
<li>Dependencies - Manage its dependencies completely and explicitly.</li>
<li>Configuration - Keeps config out of the code, prefers environment variables and setting values per deploy.</li>
<li>Backing services - views all other services as backing services, whether they’re in-house or third party.</li>
<li>Build, release and run - These states are strictly separated from each other.</li>
<li>Processes - Given that processes can disappear at any moment, all processes should be stateless.</li>
<li>Port binding - self-contained and self-sufficient, requiring no runtime injection and exposing itself on a port.</li>
<li>Concurrency - Applications need to be able to scale horizontally, so there might be more than one instance of the service running at a time.</li>
<li>Disposibility - Processes are completely disposable as they are quick to start up and graceful to pull down.</li>
<li>Environment parity - The application should at all times work on all environments (development, production, etc) and environments should be as similar as possible.</li>
<li>Logs - Logs should be output to stdout and stderr and one should use some external tool for handling logs.</li>
<li>Admin processes - These should run as one-off processes, in an environment identical to the one in which the application is running.</li>
</ol>
