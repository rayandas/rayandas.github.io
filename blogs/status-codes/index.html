There are around 60+ status codes but these are the most common in real life:</p><h3 id=2-success>2×× Success</h3><p>200 OK
The request has succeeded</p><h3 id=3xxs-arent-errors-just-redirect-to-somewhere-else>3xx&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t errors, just redirect to somewhere else.</h3><p>301 Moved Permanently
The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.</p><p>302 Found (temporary redirection)
The target resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client ought to continue to use the effective request URI for future requests.</p><p>304 Not Modified
A conditional GET or HEAD request has been received and would have resulted in a 200 OK response if it were not for the fact that the condition evaluated to false.</p><p>4xx Client error (it made somekind of invalid request)</p><p>400 Bad Request
The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).</p><p>403 Forbidden (API key/OAuth/something needed)
The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.</p><p>404 Not Found (we all know this one)
The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.</p><p>429 Too Many Requests (you are being rate limited)
The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (&ldquo;rate limiting&rdquo;).</p><p>5xx Something is wrong with the server</p><p>500 Internal Server Error
The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.</p><p>503 Service Unavailable (could mean proxy(nginx) couldn&rsquo;t connect to the server)
The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after some delay.</p><p>504 Gateway Timeout (server was too slow to respond)
The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from an upstream server it needed to access in order to complete the request.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright © 2025 Rayan Das</footer></body></html>
