<img src=/images/container-101-2/carbon.png alt></p><p>Now I will run docker pull and I will specify the name of the image. And Because I&rsquo;m not specifying a particular registry here, docker is going to default to docker hub, which is their public registry.
<img src=/images/container-101-2/carbon1.png alt></p><p>Now let&rsquo;s do a docker image ls
<img src=/images/container-101-2/carbon2.png alt></p><p>You can see the image is here. So now we can easily run a container based on this image.</p><p>Note: It&rsquo;s not necessary to pull down an image before you can run a container based on that image. If you try to run a container based on image that doesn&rsquo;t exist on your system, docker will simple pull it automatically from docker hub.</p><p>The one problem is pre-built images, such as the one that I shown you is that we really dont know how that image was created. It&rsquo;s entirely possible that this image might contain some malicious software, or other files that we don&rsquo;t want or we dont&rsquo;t need.</p><p>Now in some cases like with this simple alpine image, it&rsquo;s reasonably easy to verify what this image contains and how it was built.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s build an image from a Dockerfile:
<img src=/images/container-101-2/carbon3.png alt></p><p>You can see that the docker image is built form the Dockerfile.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s find the image and run it.</p><p><img src=/images/container-101-2/carbon4.png alt></p><p>So I have shown you how to pull down pre-built images and we have seen how to create custom images using some other image as a base or a starting point.</p><p>Now we can distribute the images using a registry. Typically when you build a custom image, you&rsquo;re going to use that on more than just the system that you built it on, you&rsquo;re going to want to distribute it to other systems in your environment so that they can all run that image. That&rsquo;s part of what makes using containers to distribute software so useful as it&rsquo;s easy to distribute these images, which are also typically very small.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright Â© 2025 Rayan Das</footer></body></html>
